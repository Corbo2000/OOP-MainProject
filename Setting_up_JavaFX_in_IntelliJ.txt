This is a quick rundown of how to get javaFX working on intelliJ.

1) I have provided a Google Drive link to the library
2) Extract it somewhere you will remember (you will need to know it later)
3) You may create a new project as normal in IntelliJ, or use a current one.
4) to add the library, with the project open, File->Project Strucutre -> Libraries, click the "+", 
click "java". find where you stored the downloaded library, and use the "lib" folder. 
5) Now do Run -> Edit Configurations -> modify options, click "add VM options".
6) In the top right of this window, just under the "modify options" tab, there should be a 
text field, copy this line into it changing the <file-path/to/lib/folder> line to where
your javaFX "lib" folder is installed.
